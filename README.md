# Iota Amount
 The name is an anagram for automation. I chose it because the goal is to reduce tedious tasks to where only an "iota amount" of effort is required. Automate the brainless tasks.
 This program makes use of JavaCV and Java's Robot libraries to emulate user interactions, with the intention of being as versatile and effective as possible.
